## Introduction 
 This is a self-paced leanring note for the field of computer science. For the sake of accessibility of this notebook, the solutions and demos in this notebook are mostly written in Java as Java is currently the most common programming language in the community and workplace.

## Disclaimer 
Every effort has been made in the preparation of this material to maximise the accuracy of contents presented. However, this material may still contain typographical-errors or inadvertent misleading arguments and therefore requires conscious attention when going through the material and make any calibration where necessary.       

## Acknowledgement 
It is challenging to compose an easy-to-understand notebook for a beginner or non-experience leaner to obtain knowledge from the field of computer science, it is even difficult for me as a start-up computing student to organise and present these resources and contents to the audience. This is why I am deeply greatful to the content providers and those who sharing their great learning resources on the public websites.
Here by I would like to give special thanks to Adam Florence who creates the SDD note and the [computer science lessons](https://www.youtube.com/@ComputerScienceLessons) produced by Kevin Drumm. 
This notebook will continue to update and patch any incorrect or misleading content. Please expect a more refined and comprehensive notebook as the day goes on.
