# Contributing Guide

Thank you for your time and interest in helping this notebook continue to evolve. As a contributor, your username will be added to the contributor list and your effort will be appreciated.    

In this contributing guide you will understand the contribution work flow and the note style we use. 

We are running two versions of this notebook on both GitHub and OneNote, and you are free to contribute to whichever one you find the most comfortable with. I will sync both versions from time to time just to make sure they are all up-to-date.

## Contribute to GitHub with Markdown
#### Fork and clone the repo
 Fork and clone the [repository](https://github.com/BlindTerran/ComputerScience) so that you can make changes without affecting the original files.
- Fork and clone using GitHub Desktop (GUI):
    - [Getting started with GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/overview/getting-started-with-github-desktop) will guide you through setting up the GUI for you to work on.
    - Once GitHub Desktop is set up, you can use it to [fork and clone the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop).
- Fork and clone using command line (CLI):
    - [Fork and clone the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) will guide you through the steps to fork and clone using CLI
    - Use this command in your terminal to clone `git clone https://github.com/BlindTerran/ComputerScience.git`


#### Commit and Push your update
Now you are free to make changes to the notebook, you can edit, add files or do both. Once you are happy with the changes you made, you can commit and push your update.

_please keep your commit message simple and informative e.g.ADD README.md for adding new file; UPDATE README.md; for making changes to existing file; REMOVE README.md for deleting file_ 

- Commit and Push using GUI:
    - Please follow [Committing and review changes](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/committing-and-reviewing-changes-to-your-project)
- Commit and Push using CLI:
    - [Git Commit guide](https://github.com/git-guides/git-commit) will help you through if you are making your very first commit 
    - Use `git add` to add files to the notebook if you did
    - Use `git commit -m "your commit message"` to commit changes you made
    - Once you confirmed and reviewed all the changes you made, you may use `git push` to push your update

#### Pull Request (PR)
When you are finished with the changes, create a PR so that your updates are awaiting approval.
[Creating a PR from a fork](Cran.r-project.org) will guide you through the process.

Please select `main` branch when you are asked to select a `base branch` to merge your changes.

## Contribute to OneNote

Since OneNote is basically a text editor supports rich text formatting which is fundamentally different from markdown,  and OneNote uses different collaboration and version control system, you need a access link to allow you view the notebook and make changes.

Therefore please email me at hongtingsu+contact@gmail.com and I will grant you access to edit the OneNote version of the notebook.

Once you obtain the access to OneNote, please firstly navigate yourself to `About This Notebook/Contributor Manual` and read through the entire page before you start contributing.
