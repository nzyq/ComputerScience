# Contributing Guide

Thank you for your time and interest in helping this notebook continue to evolve. As a contributor, your username will be added to the contributor list and your effort will be appreciated. 

In this contributing guide you will understand the contribution work flow and the note style we use. 

We are running two versions of this notebook on both GitHub and OneNote, and you are free to contribute to whichever one you find the most comfortable with. I will sync both versions from time to time just to make sure they are all up-to-date.
